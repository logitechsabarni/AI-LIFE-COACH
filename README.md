## 📝 Project Overview
Meet **Bob**, the world’s first AI-powered life coach… trapped inside a stapler.  
Bob delivers sarcastic, brutally honest advice while stapling your papers.  
This is our submission for **Wreckathon 2025**, where creativity and comedic value take center stage.  

Bob isn’t designed to make sense—it’s designed to make you laugh.

## 🧠 The Idea
Hackathons are full of serious apps and productivity tools. We decided to do the opposite:  
- A stapler that roasts your life choices  
- AI that gives unsolicited motivational tips  
- A meme-worthy, over-engineered concept
