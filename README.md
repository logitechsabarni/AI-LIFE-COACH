## 📝 Project Overview
Meet **Bob**, the world’s first AI-powered life coach… trapped inside a stapler.  
Bob delivers sarcastic, brutally honest advice while stapling your papers.  
This is our submission for **Wreckathon 2025**, where creativity and comedic value take center stage.  

Bob isn’t designed to make sense—it’s designed to make you laugh.

## 🧠 The Idea
Hackathons are full of serious apps and productivity tools. We decided to do the opposite:  
- A stapler that roasts your life choices  
- AI that gives unsolicited motivational tips  
- A meme-worthy, over-engineered concept  

---

## 🚀 Features
✔️ **AI-Powered Sarcasm** – “Drink water. Sleep. Try turning your life off and on again.”  
✔️ **Roast Mode** – Bob calls you out while stapling  
✔️ **Comedic Value** – Built to make judges laugh  
✔️ **Branding** – Fun illustrations & a clean design

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out
- 🎭 **Comedy Meets AI**: We used AI to create a completely ridiculous yet polished product.  
- 🎨 **Strong Branding**: A funny character (Bob the Stapler) makes this submission memorable.  
- 🎬 **Engaging Video Demo**: The 2:30 demo shows humor, creativity, and thoughtfulness.  

This isn’t just a product; it’s a joke turned into a polished tech submission.

## 🏆 For Wreckathon Judges
We know Wreckathon values **creativity** and **comedic impact**.  
Bob checks both boxes:  
- Original idea: Never-before-seen AI stapler concept  
- Humor-driven storytelling: Every line in the script was optimized for laughs  
- High effort: Professional script, voiceover, branding, and a fully packaged GitHub repo
